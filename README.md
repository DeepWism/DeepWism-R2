## 1. Introduction
We introduce DeepWism® R2(Research&Report), a revolutionary next-generation AI system based on the agents framework - a Thin-Thick-Thin Crowd Entropy Dynamics System (T3CEDS) that establishes entropy reduction as the fundamental mechanism underlying crowd intelligence. This represents a paradigm shift in AI research, moving from traditional attention-based mechanisms to entropy management as the core design principle.
DeepWism® R2 innovative architecture consists of three distinct yet interconnected layers:

**Thin Perception Layer:**
Efficiently captures high-dimensional inputs while preserving essential information and reducing input entropy

**Thick Processing Layer:**
Leverages crowd intelligence mechanisms to actively reduce entropy through structured reasoning, collaborative processing, and deep ranking

**Thin Decision Layer:**
Distills complex representations into coherent outputs, further reducing entropy to facilitate clear, actionable decisions

DeepWism® R2 achieves **27.5%** accuracy on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), surpassing OpenAI DeepResearch's **26.6%** and establishing new state-of-the-art performance. In addition, it leads on xbench-ScienceQA with **70.0%** and xbench-DeepSearch with **64.0%**, outperforming all other models.

These results demonstrate superior capabilities in:

Complex Problem-Solving: Enhanced reasoning through entropy reduction mechanisms

Uncertainty Management: Effective handling of high-entropy scenarios

Multi-Domain Generalization: Robust performance across diverse problem domains including science, deep retrieval, and logic

AI Explainability: Transparent decision-making processes through entropy dynamics

-  Crowd Intelligence Integration: The thick processing layer implements sophisticated crowd intelligence mechanisms that leverage collective reasoning patterns to systematically reduce entropy through collaborative processing and structured analysis.

-  T3CEDS Framework: The three-layer architecture optimizes information flow from high-entropy inputs to low-entropy, actionable outputs, ensuring maximum coherence and decision clarity at each stage.

**Performance Excellence: State-of-the-Art Results**

-  Humanity's Last Exam Leadership: Achieving 27.5% accuracy on HLE, DeepWism® R2 sets new benchmarks in complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating superior performance over leading models including OpenAI DeepResearch, Gemini2.5, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

-  Multi-Benchmark Dominance: Consistent excellence across diverse evaluation metrics including AIME2025 (93.3%), GPQA-Diamond (88.0%), MMLU (86.0%), and SWE-bench Verified (72.0%), showcasing robust generalization capabilities.

-  Open Research Commitment: DeepWism® R2 framework will be fully open-sourced with global API access for authenticated users, fostering collaborative advancement in entropy-based AI research.
